ffd
===

ffd is a MATLAB toolbox that implements the factored form descent algorithm, the original form of which was described in [1]. It can be used to retrieve the spatial coherence statistics of a quasi-monochromatic source given known optical system(s) and measured point-wise intensity values of the output of said field through said optical system(s).
