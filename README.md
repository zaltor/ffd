linops
===

linops is a set of MATLAB classes to implement block-wise linear operators.  It is mainly used as a submodule for other MATLAB libraries.

Installation
---

This package is not expected to be used standalone.  If you really need it, then the .m files need to be copied into a directory with the name +linops, and the directory containing that +linops directory needs to be added to your MATLAB searchpath (i.e. with addpath).
